Help to bring Fe and Ed together with Tailwind CSS, Figma and the Figma tokens plug-in to combine both.

1. Create a JSON file with the default Tailwind CSS design tokens.
2. Use the JSON file as input for the Figma Tokens plugin.
3. All the design tokens are available in Figma to create the designs.
4. Add components to the JSON file
5. Use the Composition feature from Figma Tokens to assign tokens to components in Figma.
6. The JSON is updated providing a list of tokens used for each component.
7. Those tokens are converted to tailwind classes
8. Those classes are applicable to the React components.

Bonus tracks:

- Figma Tokens sync the JSON file with GitHub
- Validation of the JSON file on the CI
